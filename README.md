This is a Kafka Stream App that aggregates events produced while processing Kinesis Video Stream using Amazon Rekognition. Each event has a timestamp and a status if there is a person in the event. It aggregates all the events based on timestamp and emits the latest event to the UI every 3 seconds. For more details about the project please refer to this readme file
